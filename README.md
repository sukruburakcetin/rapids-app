# rapids-app

The project aims to calculate the distance between two points. It shows how many hours it takes to get from one point to the other with an assumed average speed based on the calculated distances.

The current method has been tested in two different ways, using the RAPIDS library and using the regular python algorithm. 

The performance of both methods was measured. Their differences in terms of speed are compared.

RAPIDS provides unmatched speed with familiar APIs that match the most popular PyData libraries. Built on state-of-the-art foundations like NVIDIA CUDA and Apache Arrow, it unlocks the speed of GPUs with code you already know.
